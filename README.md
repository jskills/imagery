# Imagery
Python based image manipulation

Experimented with a batch process to convert images into cartoon versions of themelves.

cartoon.py will take an image or a directory of images as an argument and convert into 2 different types of cartoon versions.  All output files end up in a ./output directory.

Just an experiment so far.  There a good deal of settings and methods in the cv2 library to test.
